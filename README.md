# Simple Auction
This dApp is a simple auction that allows users to bid on an item. The highest bidder wins the item and the auction is over. Solely for NUS EE4032 Homework 2 purpose. Deployed to Sepolia Testnet: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x914bcfdab1fc33d470edbbc681dbe39322a2859c6064aa832f62afffa23e052a

Did not follow the outdated example from Homework PDF, instead used the latest Solidity compiler and the latest SimpleAuction example.
